# RedTeamInfra
Red team infrastructure automation using terraform and Digitalocean

-Before you start you must have 2 valid domains(you can get free domains at freenom.com) and 2 valid ssl certificats(you can get free certificats at zerossl.com or generate them with certbot), if you do not wish to use domains you can use IP addresses simply by modifying the 17th line of the redirector.sh file and listen on an IP instead of a domain.

-Replace tokens and ssh keys with your own, and directory paths as well if necessary.

Happy Hacking (:
